00:00:00.127 --> 00:00:02.497
- Well, it is my pleasure

00:00:02.497 --> 00:00:05.197
to have somebody that I
have admired for decades,

00:00:05.197 --> 00:00:07.403
Linus Torvalds, joining me on...

00:00:07.403 --> 00:00:10.627
At the Innovation Conference
for a conversation

00:00:10.627 --> 00:00:13.537
about history of Linux,
technology, open source.

00:00:13.537 --> 00:00:16.417
So, if you don't mind, Linus,

00:00:16.417 --> 00:00:19.447
maybe just start out telling
us the early days, right?

00:00:19.447 --> 00:00:21.907
When Linux was getting underway
and what was that like?

00:00:21.907 --> 00:00:23.737
And, take us back, right?

00:00:23.737 --> 00:00:25.387
You're now 30 years old, right?

00:00:25.387 --> 00:00:27.217
A little bit over a 30
years old for Linux.

00:00:27.217 --> 00:00:29.137
So, this has been an incredible journey.

00:00:29.137 --> 00:00:30.667
So, take us back to the beginning.

00:00:30.667 --> 00:00:37.314
- Right, so 32 years ago,
I got a new computer,

00:00:37.957 --> 00:00:40.477
and I was used to home computers,

00:00:40.477 --> 00:00:44.162
and I came from, for the geeks among you,

00:00:44.162 --> 00:00:47.887
I was used to 6502 CPUs originally,

00:00:47.887 --> 00:00:51.667
and then upgraded to the 68K series.

00:00:51.667 --> 00:00:55.537
And, the C80 camp and the 8086 camp

00:00:55.537 --> 00:00:57.457
was kind of strange to me.

00:00:57.457 --> 00:00:58.867
The ugly instructions--

00:00:58.867 --> 00:00:59.887
- What, you didn't like
that segmentation style?

00:00:59.887 --> 00:01:00.000
- I really did not like
that at all, right?
